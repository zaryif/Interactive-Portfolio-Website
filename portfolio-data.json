      "content": "I've just open-sourced a new tool I've been working on: the **Forensic Steganography Suite**. \n\nIt's designed to help in digital forensics by detecting hidden data within image files—a technique known as steganography. The tool uses statistical analysis to spot Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding, which is a common way to hide messages in plain sight. \n\nI built this using Python and OpenCV to automate the detection process that is often manual and tedious. It's fully functional and available on my GitHub. I'm planning to add audio analysis features next!",
